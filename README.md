## Introduction

Welcome to the Comparative Vehicle Detection project! In the realm of computer vision, lighting can often pose significant challenges. This project, a capstone for the Bachelor of Software Engineering at Yoobee Colleges of Creative Innovations in Auckland, was born out of the need to address these challenges, especially in the context of vehicle detection.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Application**: The application, built using Streamlit, offers a user-friendly interface. Users can easily upload their data, choose from a variety of YOLO models, and get real-time detection results.
  
- **Multiple YOLO Versions**: Users have the flexibility to evaluate pre-trained YOLO models from various versions, including v6, v7, v8, and NAS.
  
- **Custom-Trained Models**: One of the highlights of this project is the custom-trained models on challenging lighting datasets. These models have been meticulously trained to outperform their pre-trained counterparts, offering users a chance to see the difference firsthand. All the trainings were performed in Google Colab using GPU, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.

  
- **Special Event Comparison**: For those interested in a deeper dive, users can compare the performance of default models against custom-trained models on a special dataset available within the application.
  
- **User Authentication & Dashboard**: With a built-in authentication system, users can securely access the dashboard, fine-tune model parameters, view past detection results, and provide feedback.

## Concept

The primary objective of this application is to serve as a comprehensive platform for YOLO model evaluation. While there are many pre-trained models available, their performance can vary based on the specific dataset they're tested on. This platform allows users to not only test these models on their own data but also compare them against models that have been custom-trained on specialized datasets. This comparative approach provides users with a holistic view of model performance, helping them make informed decisions for their specific use cases.

Whether you're a researcher aiming to understand the nuances of YOLO models, a student like me looking for the best model for your project, or a deep learning enthusiast, this platform may offer a unique opportunity to explore, evaluate, and compare. Dive in, and let the world of YOLO models unfold before you!
