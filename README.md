# YOLO models evaluation app using Streamlit


**Bachelor of Software Engineering**  
_Yoobee College of Creative Innovation, Auckland_

## Introduction

Welcome to the Comparative Object  Detection project!  This project, a capstone for the Bachelor of Software Engineering at Yoobee Colleges of Creative Innovations in Auckland, New Zealand ü•ù.


## Features

- **Interactive Web Application**: The application, built using Streamlit, offers a user-friendly interface. Users can easily upload their data, choose from a variety of YOLO models, and get real-time detection results.
  
- **Multiple YOLO Versions**: Users have the flexibility to evaluate pre-trained YOLO models from various versions, including v7 and v8.
  


  
- **Comparison**: Engage in a detailed comparison between YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models. Analyze their performance across various metrics, observe differences in detection accuracy and processing speed, and determine the optimal model for different use cases.

- **User Authentication & Dashboard**: With a built-in authentication system, users can securely access the dashboard,  view past detection results, and provide feedback.
